# tun0-ip-address

Orginally a copy of:

[gnome-extension-lan-ip-address](https://github.com/Josholith/gnome-extension-lan-ip-address)

Merged with

[gnome-extension-tun0-ip-address](https://github.com/AdamantisSpinae/gnome-extension-tun0-ip-address)

because I wanted the tun0-ip functionality, but for use in the Gnome 45 extension format in the newer version of Kali Linux and these two projects became the one you see here. Simply for my use case of running Gnome Shell => 45 under Kali and not having the VPN to Hack The Box visible anywhere easy to see when typing commands. 

## Installation

Copy these files into a folder called 'tun0-ip-address@tomruyter.com' under {your home folder}/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and it should appear in the extensions list.
